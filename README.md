# oe-mqtt

OE-MQTT (Opportunistically Encrypted - MQTT) is a proof of concept that was completed for my honours project at Carleton University, under Professor David Barrera. Please note that while the code may technically work, there are several flaws in the design and implementation of this project. Please read my project report for full details.
